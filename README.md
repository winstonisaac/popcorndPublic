# Popcornd
[Popcornd](http://popcornd.tech) is a no-frills personal movie diary where only your opinion matters. By intentionally hiding other people's reviews, Popcornd eliminates much of social influence bias.

## How it works
Popcornd is built using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, plus the plain old combo of HTML and JavaScript. Popcornd also utilizes [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and [JWT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken).

*Disclaimer: all of the technologies listed above are probably implemented poorly.*

## Known limitations
- The website's design is not responsive. It also employs emojis which will surely display differently on different devices.
- List functionality is not implemented.
- Changing of profile picture not implemented.
- Not checked against any accessibility guidelines.
- Plus probably a bunch of other stuff.

## Brand Identity
All artworks relating to the identity and the name Popcornd are being released into the public domain.

## License

## Future
The developer currently has no plans to continue working on the service, hence the public repository. Anyone is welcome to clone the repository and continue working with Popcornd and its functionalities.
